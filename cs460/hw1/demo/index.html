                            This is one part of the assignment. For this assignment we are required to
                            make a Github Pages webpage using jekyll and create
                            a HTML file that is uploaded to a class homework repository. This document is

                    <h2>Homework Assignment Requirements</h2>
                    <p>
                        Write a multi-page, hyperlinked set of web pages on a subject of your choice. The 
                        content is irrelevant, it's the HTML and CSS that matters. Here are some specific 
                        requirements for your work: 
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                You must use Bootstrap for the layout of all pages and must demonstrate 
                                both single column layout and two or more column formatting.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                You must have a separate CSS file (e.g. styles.css) in which you write 
                                some of your own classes and that you use somewhere.</li>
                            <li>
                                You'll need a navigation bar or menu that contains links to all your 
                                pages
                            </li>
                            <li>You need to have at least one table</li>
                            <li>You must have one of each kind of list: ol, ul and dl</li>
                            <li>All main elements need to be styled consistently: use those defined by 
                                Bootstrap or use your own. But please, no obnoxious colors or backgrounds. 
                                You should attempt to make a professional and modern looking web page.</li>
                            <li>You must write all code yourself and may not use a WYSIWYG designer such as
                                Dreamweaver. Good (free) HTML and CSS aware editors include Atom, Brackets, 
                                Visual Studio Code, Notepad++ and Textmate (OS X only)</li>
                        </ol>

                            especially using Bootstrap's grid model. In this example of a table I'm going 
                            to put my current progress on the Inktober 2017 drawing challenges.
