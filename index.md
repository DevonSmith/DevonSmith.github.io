## Welcome to my portfolio

This portfolio is a collection of some of the software that I have developed in my free time and while I am a student studying Computer Science at [Western Oregon University](https://www.wou.edu). Specifically this portfolio focuses on the class content
for the Software Engineering series (CS460, CS461, CS462).

### About Me
I am a Computer Science student at [Western Oregon University](https://www.wou.edu).
